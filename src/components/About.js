                <div className='aboutme-summary'>I would describe myself as a calm, collected, and introverted individual with a strong touch of ambition and professionalism. A teacher once observed that I'm remarkably persistent, a trait I've come to value as it drives my eagerness to tackle challenges head-on.
                Tech and computer-related pursuits have an uncanny ability to make time vanish for me. This is precisely why I've ventured into the realm of Web Development, a path I'm currently immersed in.
                My passion for learning is boundless, and I am perpetually committed to self-improvement.</div>
